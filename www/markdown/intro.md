#Intro

For a while I have wanted to do a number of things:

* Write a blog app from scratch (I did this years ago with Rails, but wanted something more bare bones).
* Play with MarkDown a bit.
* Investigate CSS pre-processors.

[This](https://github.com/treidco/miniature-waffle) is the start of that, obviously without the styles so far.
